# krpc-mars

This is client code for [kRPC] -- a mod for Kerbal Space Program -- written in Rust. Mars is red because of rust on its surface, hence the name of this library.

This requires `.json` service files bundled with the kRPC mod and the [krpc-mars-terraform] library to generate rust code from them.
